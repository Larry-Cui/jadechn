??? info "Disability Policy"

    <!-- ## Disability Policy -->

    This firm is committed to complying fully with Disabilities Legislation by ensuring equal opportunity in employment for qualified persons with disabilities. This policy applies to new applicants as well as employees of the firm. In addition, the firm will not discriminate against any qualified employees or applicants who may be perceived to have a disability or who are related to or associated with a person with a disability or a perceived disability.

    ### New Applicants

    Firm positions can provide meaningful employment opportunities to persons with disabilities. The firm will not inquire about an applicant’s disability, and related questions are limited to inquiring about an applicant’s ability to perform the duties of the position.

    ### Employees

    Reasonable accommodation is available to all disabled employees where their disabilities affect the performance of job functions. All employment-related decisions are based on the merits of the situation and not on the disability of the individual. Qualified individuals with disabilities are entitled to equal pay and other forms of compensation (or changes in compensation), as well as job assignments, classifications, organizational structures, position descriptions, advancement, and seniority lists. Leave of all types is available to all eligible employees on an equal basis.

    This policy is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. The firm is committed to taking all other actions necessary to ensure equal employment opportunity for persons with disabilities in accordance with all applicable federal and provincial laws.

??? info "Disciplinary Action"

    <!-- ## Disciplinary Action -->

    In the event a problem arises with an employee of the firm, the management team with regard to the problem and the requested correction shall first counsel such employee verbally in closed session, with a follow-up review at some time certain in the immediate future.

    If the problem continues after this counseling session, the firm shall issue a formal written warning that will be presented to the employee in closed session. Employee will be asked to sign the warning as to the fact that employee has read and understands the contents of the warning. Such signature does not indicate agreement with the warning. Again, a review period of a time certain will be indicated, along with an explanation of any possible further discipline in this matter.

    A copy of the written warning will be placed in the employee’s personnel folder and a copy will be given to the employee for his/her personal file. If the problem continues beyond the written warning, further disciplinary action will be taken—up to and including termination of employment.

??? info "Equal Employment Opportunity"

    <!-- ## Equal Employment Opportunity -->

    To provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the firm will be based on merit, qualifications, and abilities. The firm will not discriminate against or harass any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or physical or mental disability, perceived disability, age, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship status, military status, status with regard to public assistance, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law.

    The firm is an equal opportunity employer. Our policy of equal employment opportunity is to recruit, hire, and assign the best qualified personnel in all of our centers and offices and to provide equal employment opportunities with respect to the retention, compensation, advancement, and development of all employees in a manner that will not discriminate against any person because of race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental handicap, military status, or any other reason prohibited by the fair employment laws. Any question or concern about equal employment opportunity should be brought to the attention of the human resources department.

??? info "Family and Medical Leave"

    <!-- ## Family and Medical Leave -->

    The Employment Standards Code (Code) requires covered employers to provide up to 8 weeks of unpaid, job-protected for compassionate care leave to eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons. The Code defines eligible employees as employees who must have worked for an employer for a period of at least 52 consecutive weeks before being entitled to leave. The employee can be either full-time or part-time; there is no limitation if the employee is part-time. The requirement is 52 consecutive weeks of employment for the same employer whether full-time or part-time.

??? info "Anti-Harassment Policy"

    <!-- ## Harassment Policy -->

    The firm is committed to providing a work environment that is free of sexual discrimination and harassment. Sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

    1. submission to such conduct is made (explicitly or implicitly) a condition of employment;
    2. submission to or the rejection of such conduct affects the making of employment decisions concerning the employee; or
    3. such conduct creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment or otherwise unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance.

    Examples of inappropriate conduct include, but are not limited to:

    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Sexually oriented or explicit remarks, including written or verbal references to sexual conduct, gossip regarding an individual’s body, sexual activities, and the like.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Unwanted or offensive phone calls, e-mails, notes, letters, text or voicemail messages, and the like.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Suggestive or sexually explicit posters, cartoons, calendars, photographs, and the like.</p></div>

    Any employee who is a witness to or the subject of any type of unlawful harassment must promptly report the matter to his/her immediate supervisor and the human resources department. If the supervisor is unavailable, or if the employee is uncomfortable contacting that person, the employee should immediately contact the human resources department. Employees may raise their good-faith concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal by the firm or its employees. All reports of harassment will be investigated in a timely manner, and all efforts will be made to maintain the confidentiality of all involved.

    Anyone found to have engaged in sexual or other unlawful harassment will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Likewise, any employee who is determined to have intentionally made a false accusation against another staff member will also be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

    This policy and complaint procedure also applies when an employee believes that a third party (i.e., vendor, consultant, etc.) or client is subjecting such employee to sexual harassment as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. The firm will not tolerate such conduct by its clients, vendors, and the like.

    The firm provides its employees with an environment that encourages creative, productive, and efficient work. The firm does not tolerate any individual’s engaging in harassment of any other individual or group on the basis of color, race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, medical condition, or any category protected by applicable federal, state, or local law and will impose appropriate disciplinary action on any individual who engages in such prohibited action. Harassing conduct is unacceptable in the workplace, and at any work-related settings, such as business trips and business-related social functions and will not be tolerated on the part of employees, vendors, or other third parties.

    Allegations of harassment will be investigated and, if substantiated, corrective or disciplinary action will be taken, up to and including administrative review and/or termination of the employee.

    - **Harassment Defined:** Harassment is unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct creating an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment that interferes with work performance or otherwise adversely affects an individual’s or group’s employment opportunities. Examples of harassment include verbal actions (including slurs, jokes, insults, epithets, gestures or teasing), visual evidence (including offensive posters, symbols, cartoons, drawings, computer displays, or e-mails) or physical conduct (including physically threatening another, blocking someone’s way, etc.) that shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group because of any protected characteristic.
    - **Sexual Harassment Defined:** Sexual harassment is defined to include any of the above conduct as well as other unwelcome conduct, such as unsolicited sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, conversations regarding sexual activities, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual or gender-based nature when:

          - Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of an individual’s employment; or
          - Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the individual; or
          - Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.

    It is the responsibility of every employee to refrain from actions that could be considered sexually harassing. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to:

    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Making unsolicited and unwelcome written, verbal, physical or visual contact with sexual or gender-based overtones. (Written examples: suggestive or obscene letters, notes, e-mails, or invitations. Verbal examples: derogatory comments, slurs, jokes, epithets, or suggestive or insulting voicemails, sounds, or noises. Physical examples: assault, touching, impeding or blocking movements. Visual examples: leering, gestures, display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, cartoons, posters, or magazines.)</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Continuing to express sexual or personal interest after being informed that the interest is unwelcome.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Making reprisals, threats of reprisal, or implied threats of reprisal following a negative response. For example, either implying or actually withholding support for an appointment, promotion, or change of assignment or suggesting that a poor performance report will be given or an unsatisfactory work environment will be created.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Engaging in implicit or explicit coercive sexual or gender-based behavior that is used to control, influence, or affect the career, salary, and/or work environment of another employee.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Offering favors of employment benefits, such as promotions, favorable performance evaluation, favorable assigned duties, recommendations, reclassifications, etc., in exchange for sexual favors.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Conversation about one’s own or someone else’s sex life.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Conduct or comments consistently targeted at only one gender, even if the content is not sexual.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Teasing or other conduct directed toward a person because of his or her gender.</p></div>

    ### Reporting

    Employees who believe that the actions or words of a supervisor, co-worker, or any other individual constitute unwelcome harassment have a responsibility to report the incident(s) as soon as possible to the firm management and/or the next level administrator who is not the subject of the complaint or the director of human resources.

    Complaints of harassment will be fully and promptly investigated. Any lawyer or other staff member who has been found by the firm to have harassed another employee or individual will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination or discharge from the firm. The complainant will be informed of the completion of the investigation and of remedial actions taken.

    No adverse action will be taken against a person for making a complaint of harassment when the complainant honestly believes harassment has occurred or is occurring or for participating in or cooperating with an investigation. Confidentiality will be preserved, consistent with applicable laws and the responsibility to investigate and address such complaints. Employees who believe that their complaint has not been satisfactorily resolved may make a written appeal to the executive officers of the firm. Where required by local law, additional procedures and requirements will be followed. Please consult your supervisor or director of human resources for details.

??? info "Employee Conduct: _Appropriate and professional behavior_"

    <!-- ## Employee Conduct: _Appropriate and professional behavior_ -->

    ### E-mail, the Internet, & Pornography

    The computer and access to the Internet and e-mail are essential tools in our office. However, we must use these tools with restraint and discipline. All lawyers and staff must remember that these tools are for office use only and that there are laws and ethical rules applicable to their use. The following is a list of rules and warnings for their use. Each staff member must remember that firm tools, computers, software and equipment are the property of the firm and may be inspected at any time by management.

    This list is not all-inclusive, and staff members are expected to conduct themselves with regard to these tools in a professional, ethical and moral manner, whether or not a specific conduct is covered here:

    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>The office computers and the software and Internet access are for business purposes only. No staff member is to use this equipment for personal communications or for game playing.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>The Internet is for business use only and may not be used for personal matters without prior permission of management. The Internet is not to be used at all for nonbusiness use during business hours.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>E-mail is for business use only and not for personal matters without prior permission of management. E-mail is not to be used for nonbusiness communications during business hours.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Pornography: Viewing of pornographic materials on the computer, whether over the Internet or through e-mail or any other means, is expressly and completely forbidden. Viewing such material without a business purpose will result in termination. Child pornography is illegal, and its viewing or introduction into the firm in any way is expressly forbidden under any circumstances. If, in the course of an investigation in a case, you discover this type of material, stop work immediately and consult management as to how to handle it. If pornographic or illegal child pornography is encountered, make a written report to management immediately. It is unclear at this time under what, if any, circumstances lawyers may possess such material as part of their service as lawyers, so, extreme caution must be exercised. In all cases involving such evidence, seek and obtain written advice from management. When in doubt, store such evidence outside of the premises of the firm.</p></div>
    <div class="negative-list"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> <p>Under no circumstances should anyone receive or review or send e-mail with pornographic, off color, or immoral material. Do not forward jokes, funny stories, or other material to others where such material is not related to a case the firm is working on. If such material must be received, reviewed, sent or forwarded as part of work on a case, seek and obtain permission to do so.</p></div>

    ### Office Etiquette and Confidentiality

    Loyalty is one of the most highly prized qualities of an employee of this office. This means, in part, keeping confidential all client and office business, not airing personnel grievances outside the office, and addressing personal complaints or grievances through appropriate channels.

    It is the goal of this office to have long-term employees. Frequent turnover not only damages the morale of everyone else in the office, but also is extremely disruptive to work in progress, client affairs, and the efficient use of staff and professional time.

    Obviously, circumstances arise that sometimes make a job move necessary and desirable. If you anticipate such a move, please give adequate notification so that we may interview and hire a replacement. Two weeks’ notice, while legally adequate, is insufficient as a practical matter. Thirty days’ notice would be appreciated.

    ### Attitude and Cooperation

    Lawyers, paralegals, legal assistants and secretaries all work together for the firm and for the benefit of its clients. In a small law office such as ours, everyone is required from time to time to “pitch in” and help others when workloads so demand. By being helpful and cooperative with each other, our workday will be far more pleasant and satisfying for everyone.

    Engaging in pettiness and personalities quickly destroys the pleasant and warm environment we want in our office. There is no place here for harboring a grudge. If differences develop between you and another person in this office, speak directly with that person and immediately attempt to resolve the problem in a quiet, peaceful, and reasonable manner. If necessary, talk with human resources about problems.

    ### Confidentiality

    A lawyer’s work and all communications on behalf of a client are strictly confidential. Consequently, all work and conversation in the office is confidential and may not be discussed with anyone not working in the office, including spouses, judges, other lawyers, paralegals, and secretaries. This extends to public record information about publicized cases we handle. It is unethical to reveal to persons not employed by our firm even the fact that we represent a particular client for any reason whatsoever without the client’s permission.

    When talking on the telephone, do not reveal any information about a case or client unless specifically authorized to do so. Do not use a client’s name when other clients or other persons may overhear. When meeting with clients, files and written material relating to other clients should not be visible.

    Nothing is more damaging to a family-law practitioner than the perception in the community that a client’s business is talked about outside the office.

    ### Smoking and Drug Use

    Smoking is not permitted in the workplace or within 25 feet of the workplace. Employees are expected to dispose of all cigarette material before entering the workplace. In the event an employee consistently smells of smoke, the firm may require the employee to change clothes prior to beginning work. Smoking breaks are not permitted.

    Use of illegal drugs or the illegal use of legal drugs, including alcohol, is forbidden in the workplace or during employment-related activities. The one exception is consumption of alcohol during bar association social functions. The use, possession, distribution, or sale of controlled substances, such as drugs or alcohol, or being under the influence of such controlled substances, is strictly prohibited while on duty, while on the firm’s premises, or worksites. Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.

??? info "BENEFITS"

    <!-- ## BENEFITS -->

    The following is a list of employee benefits. The Firm reserves the right to modify or terminate
    these benefits at any time for any reason. Where the benefit arises from an established employee
    benefits plan, it is governed by the plan documents.

    - [x] Professional Organization Memberships as approved by the Firm
    - [x] Job Related Seminars
    - [x] Job Related Training
    - [x] Discretionary Bonuses and Salary Increases – Year End

    - [x] Loan to purchase a home at a CRA approved interest rate or higher rate for full-time employees who have been working for the Firm over 3 years at the management level of the Firm or as a lawyer, as approved by the Firm

    All employees are eligible for statutory benefits. Statutory benefits are mandated by federal,
    state or local law and include Social Security, Workers’ Compensation insurance and
    unemployment compensation insurance.

??? info "Law Office Procedures: _What to do when something happens?_"

    <!-- ## Law Office Procedures: _What to do when something happens?_ -->

    ### Accepting Payment

    Cash, Cheque, Debit Card, Credit Card

    ### Bookkeeping

    The firm maintains a dual-entry system to reflect payments made to clients’ accounts. The office manager sets up a client file on the Cosmolex program and enters all payments there. The secretaries set up a client file in Excel and on the server. The office manager records all deposits on the Cosmolex program.

    Two copies of all incoming checks are made. One goes into the check chronological file and the other to the left side of the client’s billing subfile. Original checks go to the Office Manager’s office after copies have been made.

    Credit-card-payment receipts are handled as follows:

    - One copy is kept in the client file.
    - One copy is provided to the client (if telephone authorization, the copy is mailed or emailed to the client).
      Cash payment receipts are handled as follows:

          - Clients must sign on one copy of the receipt
          - The signed copy is kept in a separate folder.

    ### Client Files

    We do not give our client files to anyone (including the client, other Lawyers, etc.). One exception is that we do loan the file to Lawyers who are covering the case at a hearing in place of a firm Lawyer who is unable to attend.

    Typically, we mail copies of all pleadings and correspondence to the client during the course of our representation. If the client has satisfied all financial obligations to us, an additional copy of these documents (but not Lawyer’s, paralegal’s, or secretary’s notes) and client-provided originals may be returned to the client (copies made are at the client’s additional expense).

    Always clear the release of anything with a Lawyer. Complete a removal-of-documents form, have the client sign a receipt for the removed documents (can be done on the form), and file the form in the main client file. Because there is a 30-day appeal time, we generally do not release originals, depositions, etc., before 30 days from entry of a final order.

    ### Docket Control

    Docket control is essential to a legal practice. One major malpractice risk is missed deadlines.

    - **Court Hearings:** As soon as they are known, court hearings are entered in out shared lawyer’s desk calendar
    - **Docket Control Deadlines:** Paralegals will enter all deadlines, including statutes of limitation, discovery due dates, pretrial dates, and hearing dates; Adequate advance notice dates shall be included. The paralegal also will check the Calendar daily. Minimum advance notice dates include:

          - Statutes of limitations: `3 months`
          - 30-day discovery: `2 weeks`
          - Subpoena hearings: `2 weeks`
          - Settlement conferences: `1 week`

    The paralegal or legal assistant should prepare the documents in a timely fashion and have them approved by a lawyer far enough in advance of the deadline to permit revision.

    The paralegal or legal assistant shall notify the responsible lawyer well in advance of all dates and have personal contact with the lawyer on the day before the deadline date to make sure that the task is completed (unless the paralegal has seen that the appropriate document has been filed).

    ### Telephones

    Etiquette: For most clients the first contact with a law firm is by telephone. This first contact creates an immediate and continuing image of the firm in a client’s mind, which can favorably or unfavorably affect our relationship with that client. In the past, we have actually lost a potential client due to a secretary’s perceived attitude toward the caller. The reception and service provided over the telephone can do much to create an impression of a courteous, efficient, and helpful firm and instill confidence in the client. Make every effort to help clients understand that their concerns are important to all members of the firm.

    If a caller must be placed on hold, check back frequently to see if he or she wishes to continue to wait or prefers to leave a message. If a lawyer is unavailable, offer to have the caller talk with the paralegal or the associate.
    Tell clients who call that the lawyer is “with a client,” “in a deposition,” “in court,” or “attending a conference.” Never say that she is “busy” or “unavailable.” When the lawyer is with someone, offer to take the client’s message so that the lawyer can return the call. This reflects respect for the importance of the client’s call. Never ask who is calling after telling the client why the lawyer is unavailable. Otherwise it appears that you are making excuses or the client is a “low priority.”

    Messages: Take all telephone messages on the tablet provided. Fill in the name of the caller, his or her telephone number, the person called, and date and time of call. Include your initials in case a message needs further explanation or knowing who took the message later becomes important.

    Complete each message in detail. Always record the caller’s phone number and repeat it back for verification. Even if the caller says that we have the number, record it. Always record the caller’s last name. We often have several clients with the same first name. Ask the caller to spell any name you are not sure of to avoid potential embarrassment when the call is returned.

    The white copy of the message goes in the holder on the desk. The yellow copy remains in the notebook to provide a record. Old telephone notebooks are kept in the storage room. Fill in the date started and the date completed on the cover of each phone message notebook.

    Record longer messages on white copy paper and leave it in the holder. Lawyers and paralegals should pick up messages from the holder. If the call appears important and the person called is in the office, hand deliver the call record to that person.

    Never provide home telephone numbers to anyone other than another lawyer. Never provide any information about clients. Do not confirm that someone is a client. Explain that you are not allowed to provide such information without a lawyer’s direct authorization.

    Call 911 for all obvious emergencies (fire, police, or medical).

    ### Office Security

    - **File Cabinets:** All file cabinets have locks. At various times we keep them locked. Check with the Office Manager about current procedures and do not lock cabinets unless so instructed.
    - **Doors:** Before leaving for lunch, if nobody else is in the office, check outside doors to make sure they are locked. Always lock the front door when you leave for the evening. The paralegal is responsible for keeping the door to the executive offices locked.

          The associate is responsible for keeping the outside door of the associate’s office locked. To prevent accidental entry, keep these two doors locked most of the time. The last person to leave should make sure that all exterior doors are locked.

    - **Step 2: Acknowledge their concerns**
        <br>Show empathy and validate their feelings. This can help de-escalate the tension.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “I can see why this issue is causing concern. Let’s work through it together.”

    - **Step 3: Redirect to the issue, not the emotions**
        <br>Keep the conversation focused on solving the problem, not the emotional outburst.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “Let’s focus on how we can resolve this. Can you provide more details so I can assist better?”

    - **Step 4: Set boundaries respectfully**
        <br>If the client becomes overly aggressive or abusive, set clear, respectful boundaries.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “I want to help you, but I need us to keep the conversation respectful so we can resolve this effectively.”

    - **Step 5: Offer a solution or follow-up**
        <br>Suggest a solution or a next step to help the client feel heard and move the conversation forward.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “Here’s what we can do next: I’ll review this issue and get back to you by [time]. Does that work for you?”

    - **Step 6: End on a positive note**
        <br>Close the call professionally, even if the conversation was difficult.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I’ll be in touch soon with an update.”

    ### In the Office (In-Person)

    - **Step 1: Greet the client professionally**
        <br>Stand up, smile, and shake hands. “Good morning/afternoon, [Client’s Name], welcome to [Law Firm Name]. How are you today?”

    - **Step 2: Offer hospitality**
        <br>Offer them a seat and possibly water or coffee if available: “Please take a seat, would you like some water or coffee?”

    - **Step 3: Clarify the purpose of the visit**
        <br>Ask how you can assist: “How can I help you today?”

    - **Step 4: Provide assistance or pass to the appropriate lawyer**
        <br>If it’s a quick inquiry, provide help directly. Otherwise, introduce or guide them to the lawyer handling their case: “I’ll let [Lawyer’s Name] know you’re here. They’ll be with you shortly.”

    - **Step 5: Maintain professionalism throughout**
        <br>Keep the interaction professional and friendly, ensuring the client feels comfortable and respected.

    - **Step 6: Close the meeting**
        <br>Thank them for coming and confirm any follow-up: “Thank you for visiting today. We’ll follow up on [next steps]. Have a great day.”

    ### In-Person (Difficult or Rude Clients)

    - **Step 1: Stay professional and neutral**
        <br>Maintain a calm demeanor and a professional tone, no matter how the client behaves. Body language is key; stay open and non-defensive.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “I understand you’re upset. Let’s sit down and discuss how we can resolve this.”

    - **Step 2: Listen actively and acknowledge**
        <br>Let the client vent if necessary, and show that you are listening. Sometimes, difficult clients just need to feel heard.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “I can see this situation is really important to you. I’m listening and want to understand fully.”

    - **Step 3: Defuse with empathy and understanding**
        <br>Try to find common ground, showing that you’re on their side and willing to help.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “I understand how this could be frustrating. Let’s go over the details, and I’ll do my best to assist.”

    - **Step 4: Reframe and redirect the conversation**
        <br>Politely steer the conversation away from any rudeness and back to the core issue.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “Let’s focus on the next steps we can take to address your concern.”

    - **Step 5: Use calming language and set boundaries if needed**
        <br>If the client is being abusive or aggressive, calmly but firmly set limits.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “I want to help you, but we need to keep the conversation respectful. If we continue like this, I’ll have to ask you to leave, and we can reschedule.”

    - **Step 6: Stay solution-focused and follow up**
        <br>Suggest a resolution or an action plan, so the client knows their issue is being handled.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “Here’s what I’ll do to address this. I’ll review the details with the team, and we will update you by [time].”

    - **Step 7: End the interaction on a constructive note**
        <br>Ensure that the client leaves the conversation or meeting with a sense that progress is being made.
        <br>*Example*:

        > “Thank you for your patience. We’ll work on this and be in touch shortly with a solution.”
