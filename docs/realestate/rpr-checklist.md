# A checklist for a real property report (RPR) review

## Legibility Check

Ensure that the entire report is legible and all text and drawings are clear.

## Property Address and Legal Description

Verify that the property address and legal description in the report match the details provided in the official documents.

## Surveyor's Certification Regarding Encroachments

- [x] Confirm that the surveyor has provided a certification regarding encroachments, and that there are no noted encroachments.
- [x] Verify that the surveyor has provided a certification regarding encroachments.
- [x] If there are any encroachments onto city property:

      - Check with the city's encroachment department or refer to city guidelines to confirm if an Encroachment Agreement (EA) is required to rectify the issue.

- [x] If there are encroachments onto neighboring lands:

      - Check the property's title for any easements or existing EAs that might allow such encroachments.
      - If encroachments are not allowed based on title information, request an undertaking from the seller's lawyer to address the issue.
      - Confirm the holdback amount (cost to remediate the issue) and ensure it is agreed upon before proceeding with the transaction.

## City Compliance

Check if the RPR has been issued by the city and if it is stamped or marked as compliant with local regulations. Ensure that it is up to date.

## A/C Unit Inclusion

- [x] If the contract specifies that an air conditioning (A/C) unit is included, confirm that the RPR accurately reflects the presence of the A/C unit. If it's not mentioned in the RPR, consult the contract for further details.
- [x] If the contract specifies that an air conditioning (A/C) unit is included:

      - If the A/C unit was installed before June 1, 2008, request proof of installation date from the seller to confirm its inclusion.
      - If the A/C unit was installed after June 1, 2008:
          - Request an undertaking from the seller's lawyer to update the RPR to include the A/C unit.
          - Ensure that a holdback of at least `$1,000` - `$2,000` is agreed upon to cover potential costs associated with updating the RPR.

## Client Review

Send the RPR to the client for their review and confirmation. Advise them to carefully go through the report to check for any discrepancies or missing information.

## Walkthrough Reminder

Remind the client to pay special attention to the property during the walkthrough to ensure that everything mentioned in the RPR is in place and that there are no unexpected surprises or discrepancies.
