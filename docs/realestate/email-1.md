    **为了更好的准备的您的过户文件，烦请您帮助确认以下信息：**

    - 请提供您及其他共同购房人（如有）的身份证件照片。
    - 您及其他共同购房人（如有）是否可在房屋交割日前来本所（Calgary）面签所有文件？
    - 请告知将要登记在产权证上的业主姓名，如果有二人或以上需登记为业主，请告知您希望选择的产权共有形式，即 “共同共有 (Joint Tenants) ” 或 “按份共有 (Tenants in Common)"。两种共有方式的区别，请见链接：https://jadesunriselaw.netlify.app/realestate/joint/。
    - 请告知您即将过户的房产是用于自住还是出租。
    - 请您告知我们您希望登记在房产证上的邮寄地址。在房产交易完成后，政府会将有关税务和房产的信件邮寄到该地址。
    - 烦请告知此次交易是否有银行贷款， 以及贷款由哪家银行提供（如已告知，请忽略本问题）。
    - 请告知您的职业，工作单位，和职务。


    **关于房屋保险**

    如果你有按揭贷款，则房屋保险为必须项，请联系您的保险公司或保险代理，及时对房屋投保，保险期限最晚于交割日起生效。如果您购买的是townhouse或公寓, 该物业本身可能已经由管理公司办理了房屋保险，这种情况就无需再重复投保。

    在购买保险时，请您注意以下事项：

    - 物业本身的保额不能低于贷款额。如果低于贷款额，则必须有物业重置保障条款，即 guaranteed replacement clause；
    - 保单的第一受偿人（first payable to or loss payable to）必须是您的贷款银行。我们将在收到您的贷款指示后告知您银行的联系地址，该地址需要写在保单当中。

    **关于产权保险（Title Insurance）**

    除非所购物业为商业用途，否则不强制需要投保房屋产权保险。但产权保险可以极大的保障您所交易房产的过户安全，因此很多客户会选择投保。产权保险的保费为一次性费用，100 万售价的房产保费大约为 700 - 800 元。如果您需要购买产权保险，可以委托本所代办，我们需要额外收取 100 元的服务费。

    To better prepare your transfer documents, kindly confirm the following information:

    - Please provide photos of your identification documents as well as those of any other co-purchasers (if applicable).
    - Can you and any other co-purchasers (if applicable) come to our office in Calgary for the in-person signing of all documents before the closing date?
    - Please inform us of the name(s) to be registered on the property title. If there are two or more owners to be registered, please specify your choice of joint tenancy or tenants in common. 
    - Let us know if the property you are transferring will be used for own use or for rental.
    - Provide the mailing address you want to be registered on the property title. Government-related tax and property documents will be mailed to this address after the property transaction is completed.
    - Please inform us if you are applying a mortgage loan for the purchase of this property, and please also tell us the lender's name(if already provided, please disregard this question).
    - Your occupation, employer, and job title?
    
    **Regarding Home Insurance**

    If you have a mortgage loan, home insurance is mandatory. Please contact your insurance company or agent to promptly secure home insurance. The insurance policy must be effective no later than the closing date. If you are purchasing a townhouse or condominium, the property itself might already have insurance arranged by the management company, in which case, you do not need to duplicate coverage.

    When purchasing insurance, please note the following:

    - The property's coverage amount must not be less than the loan amount. If it's less than the loan amount, it must include a _guaranteed replacement cost_ clause.
    - The first payable to or loss payable to entity on the policy must be your mortgage bank. We will inform you of the bank's contact address after receiving your loan instructions, and this address must be included in the policy.
    Regarding Title Insurance

    **Title insurance**
    
    This is not mandatory unless the property is for commercial use. However, title insurance can significantly safeguard the transfer of the property you are purchasing, so many clients choose to purchase it. The premium for title insurance is a one-time fee, approximately $700 - $800 for a property with a sale price of one million. If you want to purchase title insurance, you can authorize our firm to handle it, and we will charge an additional service fee of $100.
