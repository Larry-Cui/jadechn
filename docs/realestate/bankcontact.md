**Payout Request**

You can always use [Assyt](https://login.assystrealestate.com/are/Account/Login){:target="_blank"}, a Lender Centre platform, to create a new matter and ask for payout statement.

You can also send emails to the following address to request:

- For all provinces except Quebec: [discharge.escalations@bmo.com](mailto: discharge.escalations@bmo.com)
- Quebec: [quittance.escalations@bmo.com](mailto: quittance.escalations@bmo.com)

**Funds Request**

For most cases, BMO instructions come through [Assyt](https://login.assystrealestate.com/are/Account/Login){:target="_blank"}, but you might be wrong if you think you can request funds online. 

For BMO funds request, first you need to create a request form online, fill the branch address we use for trust account, which is:

!!! tip "BMO (Telus Tower Branch)"
    Branch Transit #25129 <br>
    Add: 411 1st St SE Calgary, AB T2G 4Y5 <br>
    Tel: 403-234-1800

then sign the form and fax it to [1-844-739-1152](fax: 1-844-739-1152). Check out an example of the [RFF here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rpa1lQHB_xH-3UPXu67Hye7sYNE2l_vl/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}. BMO is quite responsive to funds request. It usually takes no more than two days before the request (it's called "Preliminary Report") shows up on the [Assyt](https://login.assystrealestate.com/are/Account/Login){:target="_blank"}.
